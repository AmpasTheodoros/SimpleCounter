# Simple Counter

This repository contains a simple counter app built using React. The app allows users to increment or decrement a number and reset it to the default value.

## Getting Started

To use the app, clone or download the repository and run `npm install` and `npm start` to start the development server. The app can be accessed at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Features

- The app displays a number that can be incremented or decremented using the provided buttons.
- The app allows users to set the default value for the number.
- The app includes a reset button to reset the number to the default value.

## Future Plans

In the future, I plan to add additional features to the app such as:

- The ability for users to save and load multiple counter values.
- The ability to customize the appearance of the app, including the color and font.
- The ability to track the history of counter values and view them in a graph.
